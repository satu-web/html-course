<h1>Life of an Ant and a Spider</h1><hr />
Behind the bush, upon the mound, <br />
ants are moving without a sound.<br />
Leaves are passed along the chain, <br />
where ants are lined as one.<br /><br />
Strands of silver make its net,<br />
a fly is caught in its web;<br />
Now it’s too late,<br>
the spider comes to seal its fate<br /><br />
<h2>Summer</h2><hr />
<br><br>
The warmth on my skin,<br>

The heat on my face,<br>

Humidity in the air,<br>

The sweat after a race.<br>

Longer days with fun and joy,<br>

Is what summer brings.<br>

The sky in a brilliant shade of blue,<br>

And so many more things.<br>

The cold, tingling feeling of the pool,<br>

As our skin gives a sigh of relief.<br>

Our minds thinking of the lazy days,<br>

When nobody is in grief.<br>

The sun shines merrily above the horizon,<br>

Sharing its heat and light.<br>

A smile on everybody’s face,<br>

As our hearts are filled with delight!<br>

<h1>Dignity </h1><hr>
Dignity <br>
You get dignity,<br>
When you stop thinking wrong<br>
When you do what you learn right <br><br>
You can live dignified,<br>
When you live a lifestyle that,<br>
matches your vision.<br><br>
You can get dignity<br>
when you renounce the “ego of individuality”.<br>
and rejoice ups and downs of life.<br>
There is dignity,<br>
when you have good thoughts,<br>
in your heart and mind.<br><br>
